# human_known_vars_gatk_qsr

I have done limited testing. Use at your own peril :)

Wrote this small terrible script because I prefer working with GenCode releases for Human datasets and GATK resource bundle needs some changes for calling the variations for Quality score recalibrations.

This is written for GRCh38 and I use Primary Assembly+Annotation from Gencode v38.
